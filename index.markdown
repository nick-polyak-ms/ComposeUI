Compose is a modernization of a propetiary legacy platform to deliver an open source container for web-first, .NET and hybrid desktop applications.

Feature gaps with respect to UI components, layout management, and subpar native hosting in other industry container solutions pointed us to investing in the creation of this standard container as an open desktop platform. It will provide a hybrid solution that meets the needs of a diverse application catalog as well as a compelling opensource alternative.

We will provide a hybrid solution that meets the needs of our diverse application catalog as well as a compelling opensource alternative. Parallel to this container, we will continue to deliver flexible components and libraries that can be leveraged standalone or in the container of your choice with long-term expectation of PWA being a strong preferred path.

The premise of Compose is to provide an open platform for not just the large existing .NET codebase and development workforce but a first-class hybrid web container for standalone web, side-by-side web, or co-mingled native/web applications. This will allow teams to continue to deliver business features and enhancements with flexibility to rewrite when time or requirements allow.
